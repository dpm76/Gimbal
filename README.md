Gimbal stabilizator for BeagleBone

This gimbal stabilizer uses two servos controlled from a BeagleBone for different purposes such camera stabilization. 

Intended to be used for rovers or drones. It uses a PID algorithm in order to stabilize, therefore its constants should be adapted depending the used hardware, in order to get best results.
